# Nick's Preferences (MacOS)

preferences is a script - written in pure bash - to set up a macOS computer with my opinionated configurations.

It can run multiple times on the same machine safely.

[Requirements](https://github.com/dotbrains/preferences#requirements) / [Install](https://github.com/dotbrains/preferences#install) / [License](https://github.com/dotbrains/preferences#license)

Requirements
------------

macOS supports:

* macOS Sonoma (14.5)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```
source /dev/stdin <<<"$(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotbrains/preferences/master/preferences.sh")"

It should take less than a minute to install.
